## [5.0.0] - 2026-09-06

### Changed

- `max_distance` no longer sets the Morgan radius. It previously meant both the
  Morgan radius and the atom-pair maximum graph distance. A separate `radius=`
  now carries the Morgan meaning, `max_distance=` applies to the atom-pair
  family only, and naming `max_distance` together with `fp_type="morgan"`
  raises `TypeError`. This is not a rename: `max_distance` still exists, with a
  narrowed meaning.
- The atom-pair window defaults changed from 0-2 to 1-30, matching OEFP's own
  defaults (`min_distance` 0 to 1, `max_distance` 2 to 30). A fingerprint built
  with the defaults is therefore not comparable to one built under 4.x.
- A descriptor sequence option supplied as an empty sequence now raises
  `ValueError` instead of being accepted. This applies at eight sites: `sources`,
  `columns`, `groups`, `variances` and `inverse_covariance` on the comparison
  paths, and `sources`, `columns` and `groups` on `descriptor_statistics`. An
  empty sequence was previously silently equivalent to omitting the option,
  which the C++ layer cannot tell apart from a real request.

### Added

- Descriptor comparisons (`DescriptorComparison`, `descriptor_statistics`) and
  coordinate RMSD comparisons (`RMSDComparison`).
- A metric-capability gate. Comparisons record what their distances guarantee,
  and the clustering entry points raise `ValueError` on a matrix whose recorded
  facts violate their assumptions. `allow_nonmetric=True` overrides the second
  tier of checks -- among them the triangle inequality and subset-scored
  distances -- but not the first, which covers distance orientation, the zero
  self-distance and non-finite entries.
- `SymmetricDistanceMatrix.from_condensed`.
- The `metric_probe`, `probe_violations` and `probe_sampled` facts.
- A `storage=` axis on `FingerprintComparison`, accepting `binary`, `count`,
  `sparse` and `sparse_count`, and a `topological_torsions` fingerprint family
  alongside `morgan` and `atom_pair`. `topological_atom_pair` is accepted as a
  further spelling of `atom_pair`.
- `SymmetricDistanceMatrix.from_file` reads sparse-storage matrices, and both
  matrix classes read the recorded facts payload. A file with no `storage_kind`
  key is read as dense, so matrices written before sparse serialization existed
  still load unchanged.
